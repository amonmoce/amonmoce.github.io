title: "Letter from Germany to Africa"
---
Hallo Africa.
It's me, Germany. How are you over there? I guess bad like all of us. But tell me, I heard from Uncle Sam that you are on the rise. Is it true, big sister?
Well, you know for me, it's not that bad. I am better than my cousins at least. Sister France is in big troubles currently, and brother UK is leaving the house. I don't care for UK; if it was Holland, I would have felt bad, she is the only one who can still drink beer with me.
Now that you are on the rise, don't forget that I apologized for what I did to you. Hmm yeah, I did, okay? And come on ... I received so many punchs from my brothers, sisters and cousins, that I don't want to hurt anyone anymore. So I don't how many died because of me, but I apologize again.
Sister, I send you this letter, because you are on the rise, obviously; at least your english-speaking part is growing fast. I am sure that if there was some german-speaking part, you would have rose faster, believe me. But this is another story. Forget it. Actually, I want to share with you a story.
