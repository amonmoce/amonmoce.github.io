title: "Who is African and who is not?"
---

==> Why ask such a simple question (Are Haitians africans? black american vs african american)

==> How did it start (definition of young Africans)

==> being African is not about the color of the skin

==> being African is not about being born in the continent

==> What is Africa anyway? Is Africa a continent ? Geography is not universal

==> African has two meanings like Chinese has two meanings

==> Africans in the continent are all aboriginal or indigenous

==> African is first about ancestry

==> African is then about the culture and traditions

==> We (Humanity) all come from Africa, but we are not all Africans

==> What unites Africans is first the land: Africa (What Africans have in common)

==> What unites Africans second is the Values (the values they have in common)

==> Africa is a nation, not a continent

==> We need a national union: for that we need to free ourselves by panafricanism, to reconnect to our culture, traditions and history by afrocentricity, and build our future through a renaissance
