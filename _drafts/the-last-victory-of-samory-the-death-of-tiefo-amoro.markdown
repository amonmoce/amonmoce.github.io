title: "The last victory of Samory"
---
Coe exerpt: What happened between Samory Toure, Guimbi Ouattara and against Tiefo Amoro; a Game of Throne like story in the middle of west Africa.

It may sound like another glorious story where Samory Toure is the hero. But this time, it's not the case. It's a story of a time when politics, military and magic were mixed together; the time when African women were influential, the time when democracy was a reality at some regions, the time when leaders could sacrifice for their people, the time when honor had a meaning, a real meaning. To understand this story, you need to know the geopolitics of the region at that time. We are in 1897


Noumoudara, this is where happened the last victory of Samory, I would rather say his last massacre. N
