title: "Teachers should be Leaders"
---

It is difficult to be student. Not because studying is hard, but because there are few good teachers. Good or not, teachers should teach and students should learn from teachers. But in what ways or conditions, a student will be able to learn from a teacher. I have tried to propose 5 levels from which students could evaluate theirs teachers.

## Teachers are not speakers - 1 star teacher
As a teacher, you can make students hear what you say, but you don't necessarily make them learn what you teach. You could be a speaker, but not a teacher; you could deliver a speech, but not a teaching. Everyone can be a speaker, but not everyone can be a teacher. Students are in the class just because you are the teacher, this is like the advantage of the authority.
So, the teacher should go beyond the authority advantage and get at least 1 star from students.
A lot of 0 star professors make their students become their own teacher. They say about a concept they have to teach, "you can learn this by yourself": but if this is true, why am I here in this class? Other professors say "go home and read the book, you will understand": if this is true, why will I go back to the class if I already understand what is in the book you want to repeat? Or sometimes, "if you don't understand what I say, go read the book again": isn't it like giving up after failing to explain something to someone ? If I cannot understand what someone tells me, how can I understand what a book paragraph says?
I met so many 0 star professors in my university - unfortunately. And this make studying hard because you cannot study something you did not learn. You will have to spend time learning it first by yourself and when you are not yet ready to study, the exams come. This is why students like solution manuals and this is also why some universities restrict the use of torrent client softwares.

## Do you like your teachers ?
If a student does not like a teacher, he will not like his teaching. If a teacher does not care about the student, the student will not care about his class neither. If a teacher likes a student, the student will like him back. If a teacher hates him, he will hate the teacher back. If the teacher is worried about him coming to class, he will be worried about the teacher sees him in the class.
Many professors I met did not care about the students, they cared about their research. Why are you teaching if you have no willing or no passion to teach ?

## Productive teachers
Students want a smart teacher. When we say "this teacher is good", it should not mean that he explains well or that he gives good grades, no. It should mean that he is good at what he teaches. He knows and he knows-how. He talks and he shows. He is theorical and practical. Some teachers are more theorical and others more practical: it's fine, because this is why a teacher assistant is important.


## Teachers for Students
Teachers should be accessible to students, not only by the official way and not only for the course purpose. Teachers are our parents at school, they can also go to students and talk as parents or as brothers(for younger teachers). You can like a teacher by the way he teaches, but if you notice that this teacher will be there for you when you need him, this is a very special feeling.


## Respectable teachers
A teacher can be respected by students and other teachers. But when you can see that this teacher really deserve the respect he has, this is good. Respect is not about the title he has, the career he has, no. It's about what he represents for people as a human being. Some students are still in contact with some teachers.  

## How many stars for your teacher
I was not that unfortunate. I met 5 stars professors who inspired me, who gave me hope - I did not tell them, but they will know some day. However, 0 star professors were so numerous in my school - professors who speak without teaching.
Most of the time, professors forget that students are like their children, brothers and sisters. The way you treat them, someone else can treat your relatives the same way. So at least, treat people the way you want them to treat you.
