My answer is, because black people are not united, period. What is happening in the US now, is also happening in [Brazil](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/06/brazil-police-accused-targeting-black-youths-160619095957017.html). Few months ago, black people in Brazil were [shouting the same way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=226e-N-JBsk), but [no one heard them](http://blavity.com/brazil-black-lives-matter/). Where is the #BlackLivesMatter in Morroco where black people [are killed](http://www.black-feelings.com/accueil/detail-actualite/article/arretons-detre-silencieux-trois-black-africain-tue-au-maroc/) just because they come [from Africa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrZcacmQRCo). Where are those African-Americans when [Indians target](http://www.rfi.fr/emission/20160604-inde-rdc-racisme-violences-contre-africains-violence-societe-diplomatie) and [kill Africans](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/african-nationals-attacks-blacks-racism-congolese-national-masonda-ketada-olivier-rajpur-khurd-vasant-kunj-2835098/) people just because they are Africans. When people talk about White Supremacy and think that it's a joke, tell them to go to South-Africa, talk to native people and [ask how they feel on their own soil](http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/opinion/2016/01/10/Why-do-white-people-despise-blacks). When people are killed in Congo(DRC), just because they live on gold-diamond-coltan-etc mines, where is the #BlackLivesMatter? This movement is concerned about African-Americans killed by the police and this is what they write on their website anyway. So is it an american problem? of course, no.

Everywhere in the world, black lives are in danger, but nobody get time for that. We live in a world where having a darker skin makes you a target of all kind of discrimination. But Americans think that this is happening only in the US. When you guys will not realize that this is a global problem, this #BlackLivesMatter will be a moment, not a movement. Just read how this started, read it on [their website](http://blacklivesmatter.com/about/): "#BlackLivesMatter was created in 2012 after Trayvon Martinâ€™s murderer, George Zimmerman, was acquitted for his crime, and dead 17-year old Trayvon was posthumously placed on trial for his own murder" . So let's suppose that, in the following weeks, Americans decide to put some policemen in prison and manage to [kill less black people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-people-killed-by-police-america_us_577da633e4b0c590f7e7fb17), in order to reduce the number of black people killed by the police. You guys will disappear and 5 or 10 years later, you will create "another movement", like this one was created after the Black Panthers. And this will go on and on, unless you accept that this is a global problem and that we have to fight together. No African-American will be in peace when Africans are killed in India, no African-latino will be in peace when Africans are mistreated in Saudi-Arabia. Because we don't only have a history in common, we also have melanine, this built-in protection that others don't have, we have it naturally.
Unless, this become a global movement, I will not feel concerned, as an African first. So, I invite all movements in the world fighting for the black people to talk to each other; we are lucky to have what our elders did not have: the network. Let's get united once for all, union is the only missing piece in our fights.
