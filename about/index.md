My full name is Amon Moce Rodolphe BAZONGO. I was born in 1990 in a small [Attie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attie) town in the south-east of [Ivory Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast) named [Akoupe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akoup%C3%A9). My mother, Amon Solange DJAMBRA, is also native of this region. A part of my early childhood was spent at [Abidjan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abidjan)(at  [Treichville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treichville) commune), largest city of the country.<br/>
My father, Herve BAZONGO, is from [Burkina Faso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso). He studied Mathematics at the University of Abidjan and became later a high school teacher and also an Entrepreneur. But his projects did not go the way he wanted: after his ice cream store business, he decided to prepare his return to his home country (my country too). When I was 5~6, he took me to Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso, to one of my cousine's. After more than a year, he came back and we went to Bobo-Dioulasso (still in Burkina Faso). We went back to Ouagadougou 4 years later and this is when I had to take the Elementary School Certificate exam. From that time, I did not leave the capital city until my last year of high school.<br/>
I decided to study Electronics and I got admitted to Polytechnic University of Bobo-Dioulasso. My studies took only two years for an Associate degree. My desire to continue led me to a private graduate school in Ouagadougou for a bachelor's level in Computer Networking and Telecommunications. A year later, the ping pong between Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso ended: I had this great opportunity to leave Africa for Taiwan, in east Asia. I am currently a Computer Science student at National Chiao Tung University, one of the best institution of the island.
